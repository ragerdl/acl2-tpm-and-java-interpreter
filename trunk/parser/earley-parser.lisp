  :short "Earley parser written in ACL2"
  :long "Disclaimer: the following is written as documentation for the
  implementors of this Earley Parser.  Indeed, these comments should really be
  part of the source code in the long-run.
  
  Earley Parsers are often also called \"Chart parsers\", because the EP
  terminology dictates that every time the next token in a sentence is read,
  that a new chart is created.  Each chart contains a set of \"states\" that
  roughly correspond to rules in the specified grammar that are in different
  states (depending upon what input has already been seen).

  The EP algorithm starts with exactly one chart, with the starting state as
  its only state.  Through prediction (and in later states, scanning and
  completion) more states get added to this initial chart.  At some point a
  part of speech is encountered, which triggers a scan, which causes the
  chart-index to be incremented, and the next set of states that are created
  are added to a new chart.  This continues, where new charts are created and
  states are added to each of those charts.  In a concrete sense, a list of
  charts is just a list of a list of states.")
