\nclean.pl: clean up generated files from running cert.pl

This script removes temporary files like foo.cert, foo.cert.out, foo.time, etc.
Ordinarily there would be no reason to call this file by hand, instead it would
usually be run by invoking "make clean" or similar.

Usage:
clean.pl [OPTIONS]

Options:

    -h          Show this help message and exit immediately
    --help

    --dryrun    Print what will be deleted, but do NOT actually delete
                any files.
